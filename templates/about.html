        The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
        recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when Smaug
        came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf
        decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf
        also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The
        superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other
        business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

            <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
            <p>
                Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to the Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in his youth,
                Thorin and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug, in TA 2770. While in
                exile, he quickly grew into a capable warrior. This was demonstrated at the Battle of Azanulbizar, near Moria, in TA
                2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath Moria's East-gate, and at some point in the battle, his
                shield broke, and, using an oaken tree branch found on the ground as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield,"
                which remained with him even in death.

            <p>
                Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother, Dís. They were also nephews of
                Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his long nose,
                the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.

            <h3>Oin</h3>
            <p>
                Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. Óin's uncle was Fundin, the
                father of Balin and Dwalin.
                Óin fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined Thorin's company on the
                quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain, wearing a brown hood.[2] Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that Bilbo would
                come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin were usually in charge of preparing
                the fire for the Company, as they were the most skilled of the group. He fought in and survived the Battle of Five
                Armies, and later settled in the Lonely Mountain with King Dáin II Ironfoot, along with many other Dwarves of the
                company of Thorin.

            <h3>Golin</h3>
            <p>
                Glóin was born in TA 2783, after the dragon Smaug desolated Erebor. He was the younger child of Gróin and younger
                brother of Óin.
                In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar, the last battle of the War of the Dwarves
                and Orcs, though it is unknown how significant his contribution was, being 16 years old.
                In TA 2879, in the Blue Mountains, while in exile, his son Gimli was born to him and an unknown wife. In March of TA
                2941 in Bree, Thorin Oakenshield met by chance the wizard Gandalf the Grey, pushing Thorin to reclaim Erebor, so
                that Smaug wouldn't ally with Sauron. When Gandalf mentioned Hobbits, Glóin referred them as "simpletons" and also
                said that Hobbits "would never dare to come within smelling distance of the nakedest dragonet new from the shell".

            <h3>Balin</h3>
            <p>
                Balin was likely born in the Lonely Mountain before the coming of the dragon Smaug. He had a younger brother named
                Dwalin, and was amongst those driven from their homes when Smaug attacked the Lonely Mountain. Afterwards, he may
                have lived in Dunland as a refugee, before fighting in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs which culminated in the
                Battle of Azanulbizar. Many years later, in approximately TA 2841, he accompanied Thráin II, the father of Thorin,
                when he attempted to go back to the Lonely Mountain himself. Thráin was captured and lost.

                brother of Balin. After fighting in the Battle of Azanulbizar at the age of 27, Dwalin accompanied Thráin II and
                Thorin Oakenshield to settle peacefully in the northern Ered Luin.

                Ori lived in Thorin's hall in the northern Blue Mountains for many years, alongside his cousins: Dori and Nori. In
                the year TA 2941, Ori became a member of Thorin's Company and travelled with Thorin, Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins, and the
                other Dwarves on the quest for the Lonely Mountain, culminating in the death of Smaug. Finally, he and the other
                Dwarves of Thorin's Company fought in the Battle of Five Armies in TA 2942, which he survived.

                his familial relations are unclear, and what is known of his parentage is very little. He and his family were driven
                out of their home in the Lonely Mountain by the dragon Smaug, and were forced to live in exile, where the Dwarf
                warrior worked as a toy maker. Following Thorin II Oakenshield to a new life at his halls in the Blue Mountains, he
                continued his life as a toy maker.
